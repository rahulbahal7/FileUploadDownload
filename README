UPDATES: 

This update consists of Code Updates, User Experience updates, major bug fixes like
exception handling in a File Download scenario.



CODE UPDATES: 


1. FileUploadController

    a. While uploading a file, three scenarios have been handled to improve the functionality:
    
          i. When user provides no name on the form, the original file name is considered.          
         ii. When the user provides only a name, but no extension for the file, the name with 
             given name is stored along with the extracted file-type from the original file to 
             maintain consistency.             
        iii. When the user enters a filename with the extension, the file is stored with the
             provided name and extension.
    
    b. Appropriate messages are displayed as per the above 3 scenarios.
    
    c. Performance update: Killing of the File/Buffer objects to prevent memory leakage.


2. FileDownloadController

    a. A page with an error message is displayed when the user enters an invalid or non-existant
       file name instead of being redirected to an error page(which was present earlier due to 
       inefficient exception handling).
       
       
3. General Updates:

    a. Improved user experience on Home Page
    
          i. Upload button gets enabled only when a user browses and selects a file to be uploaded.          
         ii. The user is displayed a prompt if a file name is not entered while Downloading a file.         
        iii. The user is asked for a confirmation "Do you want to save the file with original name?"
             when he tries to upload the file and does not provide a file name. If the user agrees
             by clicking "OK", then the file is saved with it's original name. Otherwise, the same
             page continues to display.
            
            
            
4. CSS Improvements to support better User Experience.



5. In order to have maintainability of code, addition of a seperate javascript file to handle the client 
   side validations.
